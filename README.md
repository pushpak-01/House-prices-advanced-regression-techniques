# House Price Prediction Analysis
## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling on the Ames Housing dataset. The goal is to predict house prices using various machine learning techniques, including linear regression, Ridge, LASSO, and ElasticNet.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is based on housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa. It includes a wide range of explanatory variables concerning almost every aspect of residential homes.

### Files
1. train.csv: The training set with data on 1460 houses and 81 features, including the target variable SalePrice.
2. test.csv: The test set which is used to test the predictions from our models.
3. data_description.txt: Detailed description of each feature in the dataset.
4. sample_submission.csv: An example of a submission file in the correct format.
### Methodology
#### Data Preparation
1. Loading Data: Data from CSV files was loaded into Pandas data frames.
2. Handling Missing Data: Missing values in key columns were imputed or filled with 'None' where appropriate.
3. Feature Engineering: New features were generated from existing data, and transformations were applied to normalize skewed data.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Visualizations were created to understand the distributions of key variables and to identify relationships between features and the target variable.
2. Correlation analysis was performed to pinpoint the most relevant features for predicting house prices.
### Predictive Modeling
1. Linear Regression: Served as the baseline model.
2. Regularized Models: Ridge, LASSO, and ElasticNet were used to manage model complexity and prevent overfitting.
3. Model performance was evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need Python and the following libraries:
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-learn
